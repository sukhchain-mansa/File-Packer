# File-Packer

This is a file packing program as the name implies. The standard file system takes a lot of time in reading and writing files directly from memory, the idea is to create a packing and unpacking liberary which can be used in software like games in which resources are needed very ofter and need to be loaded quickly. 
A command line tool will also be created to pack the sources and bake them for the program that will use this library.
